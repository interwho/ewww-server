# ewww-server

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH EWWW IN ANY WAY!**

Sets up a basic image minification server for DIY (read: no paid API access
required) image minification on Wordpress when your host blocks exec
(I'm looking at you WPEngine).

Implements the API used by ewww-image-optimizer-cloud for Wordpress.

## Setup

To install ewww-server, you'll need a server running Apache2 and PHP7. You will also need to have SSL enabled.

Install the image optimizers using the following commands as root (for Debian Linux):

```
apt-get install -y php php-gd php-dom
apt-get install -y advancecomp pngcrush gifsicle jpegoptim
apt-get install -y libimage-exiftool-perl
apt-get install -y imagemagick pngnq tar unzip libpng-dev git
apt-get install -y optipng pngquant
apt-get install -y libjpeg-turbo-progs
```

You'll also need to install pngout (replace x86_64 with your architecture if required):

```
cd /tmp
wget http://static.jonof.id.au/dl/kenutils/pngout-20130221-linux-static.tar.gz && tar xvf pngout-20130221-linux-static.tar.gz
mv pngout-20130221-linux-static/x86_64/pngout-static /usr/bin/pngout
```

Then, simply extract this package into your webroot, and enjoy!

## Plugin Setup

Run the following two commands in bash in the ewww-image-optimizer-cloud
plugin directory (replace 10.0.0.1 with your server IP):

```
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/optimize.exactlywww.com/10.0.0.1/' {} \;
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/stats.exactlywww.com/10.0.0.1/' {} \;
```

Then, zip and install the plugin. Enter anything for the API key. Bulk Optimize should work fine after that!

These commands were last tested on plugin version 4.0.3.

## Other Notes

This package **ONLY** does the image minification! Options from Wordpress
are ignored, and all non-image-optimizing routes are mocked (and will not
return real data).

JPEG image rotation correction has not yet been implemented.

There's a composer package in the v2 directory, however, I've gone ahead
and committed the vendor files, so there's no need to run composer again.
